## Collaborating with Peers

I strongly encourage working on the exercises in pairs or small groups up to three people. You have to find out what works best for you. I also encourage getting help from other people, be it other groups in your semester or the [Lernzentrum Informatik](http://www.htw-berlin.de/studien-und-weiterbildungsangebot/lernzentren/lernzentrum-informatik/) if you get stuck with the exercises. And I also encourage helping other people - it's a great way to learn and deepen the understanding of a subject.

Depending on the class and exercises you may also turn in group work, and especially in the first semester but also in other classes I like to draw groups by lot to give you the opportunity to work with different people and get to know more people in your semester.

But still, you have to do work yourself, understand at least 50% of each topic to pass and I have to make sure that you do.

Therefore, I will interview each one of you 2-4 times during the semester (during the lab) and ask you to explain your solutions/reports to me. If you worked on them yourselves, you should have no trouble answering the questions. If you fail to present/explain your solution to me or happen not to attend this lab, I will give you a second opportunity the week after - not necessarily with the same exercise, that would be to easy ;-). If you continue to fail to be able to explain your solutions/show up in the lab, **points will be removed from your lab report ratings.**

Also see the guidelines on how to clarify collaborations in your reports below.

## What to hand in
The assignments will clearly state wether you need to hand in a PDF, source code or both. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   if both PDF and source code have to be submitted, upload two files: a PDF and a zip with the source code. If the Source Code is within one single file, you can upload this directly instead of the Zip. Please do **not** include the PDF in the ZIP file.
*   If only a PDF has to be submitted, hand in the PDF. If only source code has to be submitted, hand in only the zip/single file.
*   **Include the names** of all people in the group **at the top** of the PDF *and* **at the top** of each (relevant) source code file. If you collaborated with further people, do state so **at the beginning** of the files.
*   If you hand in your work in other formats, e.g. Word file instead of PDF, rar archive instead of zip, you might be lucky that I will grade it anyway if the computer I happen to work on opens it without complaints. If not, I will not go through the hassle of installing other software / watch my mac opening MS Word and might decide to not grade your submission.
*   I **will assign 0 points** to all work handed in by more than one group/person without stating the names of the others. That is, if you work on an exercise together with others, or help them with it, make sure all of you make that &#8220;collaboration&#8221; clear in their reports, and do so yourself in your report, otherwise you might receive 0 points as well.
*   **Submit your complete work on time**. There is no point in emailing me if you didn&#8217;t. Everybody has a cold now and then, but if you miss just one week (and your group wasn&#8217;t able to upload it for you&#8230;) you still have the chance of getting enough points for a 1.0 as there is enough slack in the grading. If you become seriously ill and miss more than one week, make sure you collect medical certificates (ärztliche Atteste) immediately and email me/talk to me asap and we will find a solution.
*   **Submissions not adhering to these guidelines will not be graded.**

## Grading of Lab Reports and Exercises

Additionally to the Grading of the Exercises I will ask you to explain some key points to me in the following lab. I won't have time to talk to each one of you each time, but will try to talk to each of you at least two or three times during the semester. You will need to be able to explain your solution to me, for the obvious reason to make sure that if you haven't done all of it yourself, you at least understand the solution you've put together with help of others. (Which might, depending on the work )

### Star Gradings for Exercises

| Stars | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **\*\*\*\*+** | Exceptional – above and beyond the call of duty. Very seldom. Additional red star. |
| **\*\*\*\*-** | Excellent: All of the exercises completed and an excellent report. |
| **\*\*\*–     ** | Very good: All of the exercises completed, and a good report that may have some minor problems. |
| **\*\*—    ** | Good: Something is missing, although the report is good, or the report has major problems. |
| **\*—-** | Satisfactory: Nothing worked, but you had a good report. |
| **—–** | Nothing worked, but you managed to scrape together a report. Or you did a million bells and whistles, but turned in a half-page report using bullet lists of misspelled sentence fragements that are, however, technically a report on time. |
| X | Late work, not handed in |
