This is part 2 - refer to [Part 1](../lab-04-usecases) for the assignment.

Don't worry too much about the differentiation of Part 1 and 2, just add 
missing parts and refine your design based on what you've learned.

Depending on the reviews of Part1, additional guidance might be added here.

## Results Submission
* Hand in a lab report (including your diagrams)
