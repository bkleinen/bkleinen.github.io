## Pre-Lab
* Read Martin Fowler's Chapter about Sequence Diagrams from the book "UML Distilled" [is available as a sample chapter online.](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=169507)


## Assignment

### Part 1: Sequence Diagrams of Known Classes

As an introductionary exercise for Sequence Diagrams, pick one of the following example projects from Info1 and draw a sequence diagram for the main use case:

* The [Clock Display](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/chapter03/tree/master/clock-display-with-GUI) / Use case: timeTick() is called
* [Tech Support](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise07-archived/tree/master/tech-support) / Use case: user command is entered (start() methodin SupportSystem)
* The [Zuul Project](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise10) /  Use case: user enters command (method: play() in Game.java)

If you didn't do Info1 with me / do not know these projects: it doesn't really matter - just read the source code. 

### Part 2: Sequence Diagrams for the App

Take your scenarios from [the usecases and class diagram exercises](../lab-04-usecases) and have a good look at them. There are a number of processes that you should have detailed in your scenarios - if not, now you learn how to be thorough :) 

Now, draw sequence diagrams for the designed App: Each one in your team pick a different use case / scenario and draw 
a sequence diagram for it. Then discuss and consolidate them.


## Results Submission

* Hand in a lab report (including your diagrams)
