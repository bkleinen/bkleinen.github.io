## Course Literature and References

There is no textbook for this class. Here are the main books this class
is based upon. You'll don't need to buy them for this class - there's plenty of information online. 
Some of them can be found in the library.
You might want to buy them, though, as these are books that will not be
outdated next year - some of them might even be the same age as some of you.
