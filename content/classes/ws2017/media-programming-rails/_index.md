## Welcome!

This pages introduce you to the web application part of the "Epochenunterricht" in M1 Mediaprogramming.
The Epochenunterricht consists of 3 x 5 laboratory sessions for the three study focuses Web Technology,
Visual Computing and Game Technology respectively. Have a look at the [tentative overall schedule](overall-schedule) to
see how this breaks down.

## What we will do

Within the five weeks of Web Technology, you will work on your own Web Application Project in a more or less
agile manner. Less agile, because you will work on the user stories not in the order of business value, but
in a technology driven order.

## What you need to do to pass

This is one part of the M1 laboratory. You need to pass each of the three parts to pass the Labs altogether. There are no grades,
just a "passed" or "not passed" as well as for each part as for the three parts together. You need to pass
each part - Web Technology, Visual Computing and Game Technology - to pass the lab part of M1 Media Programming.
There will also be questions in the exam regarding topics covered in all three lab parts.

For Web Technology, you will have to prepare and hand in 3 project reports together with the source code of
your projects. The project reports have to be prepared as PDF and describe what you did, what you learned, what worked and
what didn't work. You'll find detailled instructions for each week in the [assignments](assignments). The project reports are due at 22:00
on the night before the next meeting and need to be uploaded to Moodle.
