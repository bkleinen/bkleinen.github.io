# Welcome!

Info 1 is an introduction to object oriented programming using the Java language. In this class we will be using BlueJ as the main development environment and learn about writing programs, designing simple algorithms, about control structures, data types and structures, objects and classes.

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab:

* Lecture: Tuesdays, 9:45 -11:15 and 12:15-13:45 in WH-C 353
* [Labs:](labs)
  * Group1: Tuesdays, 14:00 - 15:30 in WH C 537
  * Group2: Thursdays, 09:45 - 11:15 in WH C 579

## Grades

Your grade in Info1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale](/general/grading-scale.html):

* Lecture summaries: 10%
* Lab reports: 50%
* Exam: 50%

More info about the Lecture Summaries and the Lab Reports can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination on or about Feb 11. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2. The examination will cover Java programming and conceptual understanding in ways that may be difficult to assess during the laboratory sessions. The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part.

## Tutorial and Lernzentrum

If you struggle with this class, need more support with the exercises or simply don't like studying alone:
There is a tutorial held by Alexander Becker and the [Lernzentrum Informatik](http://www.htw-berlin.de/studien-und-weiterbildungsangebot/lernzentren/lernzentrum-informatik/) that offer opportunities to practice.

## Java-Tutorials and Book

Most of this lecture will be based on: D. Barnes; M. Kölling: **Objects first with Java. A Practical Introduction using BlueJ**; Pearson Education. 5th edition. 

German translation: Barnes, David J., Kölling, Michael: Java lernen mit BlueJ. Pearson, 2012, 5. Auflage. [Pearson](http://www.pearson-studium.de/main/main.asp?page=bookdetails&ProductID=199389)


There are tons of Java Tutorials out there on the web, my recommendation are the [Tutorials by Sun/now Oracle][7];** especially the [Trail &#8220;Learning the Java Language&#8221;][8]. **
