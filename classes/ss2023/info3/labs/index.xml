Assignment Preparation Download the source code snippets for this assignment: lab04-testing Prepare your project like we did it in the first lab (Part 1: Set up the git repository and project). Note that this is now lab04, so make sure you adapt your process to that! Eg. put the project into the correct place on the gitlab server. In addition to what you&amp;rsquo;ve covered in class, please have a look at black-box and white-box testing.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 05 - Legacy Code - Refactoring to Patterns</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-05-legacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-05-legacy/</guid><description>The Gilded Rose, Trade District, World of Warcraft.
Assignment: Gilded Rose Kata Preparation Clone the Gilded Rose Repository. Set up the project like we did it in the first lab (Part 1: Set up the git repository and project). Of course this is now lab05, put your project into the correct place on the gitlab server! Hint: If you like you can use WebStorm and it&amp;rsquo;s automatic refactoring features. You can get an educational license.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 06 - Rails - First Steps</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-06-rails-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-06-rails-1/</guid><description>Foto by Pedro J.

Revised - without significant changes to the assignment itself except taking out Factory Girl/Bot - on 1/1/18. If you&amp;rsquo;ve started working on this assignment before, you can view the changes in the commit &amp;ldquo;info3 - revised lab 06&amp;rdquo; on bkleinen.github.io
Prelab The Base Repo (referred to as main repository below) for this Lab is the HTW Application we&amp;rsquo;ve developed in class, see https://github.com/htw-imi-info3/rails-dash-ws2017 - first fork it on github (only one person in your team needs to do this) and then clone it to your local workspace (computer).</description></item><item><title>Assignment 06 - Web Apps with Node and Express I</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-06-express-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-06-express-1/</guid><description>Overview In the course of this and the following Lab Assignment, you will implement a rudimentary web application based on node and express.js.
The goal of the exercises is gain first experiences with fundamental steps of web application development, rather than completing the app!
In the end, your app is expected to have the following features:
Lab 06 - Express 1 contain at least 1 view template displaying data that is hard-coded in the controller process parameters sent from an HTML form in the controller MVC: View and Controller should be clearly separated, e.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 07 - Search &amp; Sort, Internationalization</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-07-rails-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-07-rails-2/</guid><description>Assignment Part 1: Add a Sort or Search Functionality Each Group should add a sort or search functionality to one of the resources pages of the HTW app. We will coordinate the tasks using issues on the repository, see https://github.com/htw-imi-info3/rails-dash-ws2017/issues, and also coordinate within the lab.
See the Guide on the Active Record Query Interface - it contains all necessary information on how to query and sort Pumpkins and other stuff.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 07 - Web Apps with Node and Express II</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-07-express-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-07-express-2/</guid><description>Example apps: App 03 - Persistence and App 04 - with testing

From Lab06 to Lab07 You will continue working on your project from Lab06. However, it should be in a separate code base. So you should create a new empty repository on GitLab in the folder for Lab07 and add this new repo as the new origin of your local repository. For Lab07, only push to the project in the Lab07 folder!</description></item><item><title>Assignment 07 - Web Apps with Node and Express II</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-08-express-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2023/info3/labs/lab-08-express-3/</guid><description>From Lab07 to Lab08 You will continue working on your project from Lab07.

This Startup Lab is about installing the tools you need for Python Programming and getting some (more) hands-on experience with git, so start with that. If bored, move on to try python.
Which Computer to use? In my experience, all Students prefer to use their own computers, which is possible as all Software we&amp;rsquo;ll use and need is free to use (at least for Students).</description></item></channel></rss>
