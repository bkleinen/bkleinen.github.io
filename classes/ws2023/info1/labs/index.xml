Intro Welcome to the laboratory - that&amp;rsquo;s what we call these rooms filled with computer equipment. We have lots of rules for the labs, as they are used by many different people during the week. You find a link to the rules (&amp;ldquo;Laborordnung&amp;rdquo;) here.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 01: Sending Messages to Objects</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-01/</guid><description>sequenceDiagram actor You create Participant Picture You->>+Picture:new() You->>+Picture:draw() create Participant Circle Picture->>+Circle: new() Circle-->>-Picture:circle Picture->>+Circle: makeVisible() Circle-->>-Picture:void Picture-->>-You:void This week&amp;rsquo;s lab is all about exploring given Objects by sending them messages (aka in Java: calling methods) - and writing your first programs by putting them together in your own methods.
What to bring to lab P1. In the lecture we have talked about data types called int and String. Java has more predefined primitive data types.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 02: TicketMachine</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-02/</guid><description>Printed Ticket.

Source code for this exercise: https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/chapter02
Pre-lab 1. What could be wrong with the following constructor? Don&amp;rsquo;t execute it, think about it in your head.
public TicketMachine (int ticketCost) { int price = ticketCost; balance = 0; total = 0; } 2. How can you tell the difference between a method and a constructor just by looking at its header?
3. What do you think would be printed if you altered the fourth statement of printTicket so that price also has quotes around it, as follows: System.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 03: Book Exercise</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-03/</guid><description>Books.

This week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended to practice creating classes with data fields, constructors, methods, assignments and conditional statements.
Pre-lab What to Bring to Lab Please finish these exercises before coming to lab.
P1. Why does the following version of refundBalance not give the same results as what we saw in class?
public int refundBalance() { balance = 0; return balance; } P2.
What happens if you try to compile the TicketMachine class with the following version of refundBalance?</description></item><item><title>Exercise 04: Rock Around the Clock</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-04/</guid><description>Katarina Elevator in Stockholm, Foto by Arjan Richter
This week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended to get you to implement parts of a class that is given for you. You are also to begin to see the idea of modularization, that is, splitting up code into classes.
Pre-lab P0. Which of the following expressions returns true? After writing your answers on paper, open the CodePad in BlueJ and try it out.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 05: A Better Notebook</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-05/</guid><description>Foto by waferboard
This week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended help you practice using loops.
Pre-lab P0. Write a loop on paper that prints out all multiples of 5 between 10 and 95.
P1. Write a method called sumBetween that adds up all numbers between two numbers, a and b, that are passed into the method as parameters. Include a but not b in the sum.
P2. Assume you have a collection of students called imi1.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 07: Lotto and Technical Support</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/exercise-06/</guid><description>This week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended give you practice using more classes from the Java API: the Random class, Sets and Maps.
Pre-Lab Prepare your prelab before coming to class! Doing the pre-lab will save you time during the lab.
P1. How do you generate random numbers between 1 and 10 with Java? In what package is the library?
P2. How do you define an array that can count how often the numbers between 1 and 10 are generated?</description></item><item><title>KaraClock Complete</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/karaclock-complete/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2023/info1/labs/karaclock-complete/</guid><description>This is a complete overview of the KaraClock Exercises that lead to the implementation of the KaraClockDisplay-Example. The exercises are distributed through three Labs, as shown by the headlines here.
The material section contains an article about why I made this addition to the ClockDisplay example: ClockDisplay Example: Reflections and Improvements.
Open the Greenfoot-Kara project https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/kara-clock-lab. It contains several test worlds. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve instantiated the correct test world!
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, you need to install Greenfoot to open the scenarios.</description></item></channel></rss>
