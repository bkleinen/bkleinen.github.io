&lt;p>This weeks work has two main parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>perform a Paper Prototype Usability Test&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up your Project with SCM&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="paper-prototype-usability-test">Paper Prototype Usability Test&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Use the time in class to run a brief usability test based on your paper prototypes.
Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re testing a clearly defined tasks, and assign the roles User, Human Computer,
Facilitator/Notetaker and Oberservers as described in &lt;a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/paper-prototyping-as-a-usability-testing-technique/">Paper Prototyping As A Usability Testing Technique&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Project description: Describe your Project on about half a page in complete sentences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a github repository and list your project in the wiki: &lt;a href="https://github.com/htw-imi-wt1wa-ws2015/rails-projects/wiki">https://github.com/htw-imi-wt1wa-ws2015/rails-projects/wiki&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create Use Case Scenarios accompanied with Screen Scribbles for at least one Use Case per Person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design a Domain Model for your Project. Document it using UML. It should show the associations between the Model classes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Rails app and your models. You can use the scaffold generator. You need not yet add the associations in the Rails app.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag your project: &amp;ldquo;WEEK01&amp;rdquo; and upload it to github.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put your project description, Use Case and Class Diagrams and Scenarios into a PDF-Report and upload it to moodle.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Web Applications WS2019/2020 - Homework 11</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week11/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="homework-for-week-11--sprint-7">Homework for Week 11 / Sprint 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You just keep working on your Project, one Story in your Backlog at a time:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>include the backlog in your report. For each story, list
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>its number/id&lt;/li>
&lt;li>its name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>storypoints&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sprint(s) it was/is in (eg. sprint3, or: sprint4(committed, but not completed) sprint5 (completed) etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>include your level of done in each report, such that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to search for it. (you should have that starting with sprint4)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for each story you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, write down acceptance criteria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tests for the stories should be included both in level of done and the acceptance criteria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>report on what worked, what didn&amp;rsquo;t, how you solved especially difficulties.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for the described tasks, please include a link to the main file(s) you needed to change for that or make the changes clearly visible in a commit comment (e.g. &amp;ldquo;Story #38: created search box&amp;rdquo;) and note that in your report.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag your project: &amp;ldquo;SPRINT7&amp;rdquo; and push it to github (or another git server). Provide a link in your report.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and how you solved them - and the project description, the backlog and the stories you worked on during the sprint. See the details above!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And yes, this is the same as last week. Would be great if more than 50% of the reports would adhere to this requirements!
And this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t want links to google docs etc in the reports:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web Applications WS2019/2020 - Homework 2</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="homework-for-week-2">Homework for Week 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re clear on the associations between the classes in your domain model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create Migrations for adding the foreign keys and, if needed, association tables to the database. Write down the commands you used. You should have at least two associations of different kinds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the migrations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experiment using the rails console to create AR Instances and Associations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>using this, create a rake task db:populate to create example data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag your project: &amp;ldquo;WEEK02&amp;rdquo; and push it to github.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upload your PDF-Report to moodle.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>update 5.11.2015 19:30: as we didn&amp;rsquo;t cover all of the topics, these two things will be
postponed to next week:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web Applications WS2019/2020 - Homework 3</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2019/m-wt1-webapplications/assignments/week3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="homework-for-week-3">Homework for Week 3&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Decide on (at least) one more advanced view making use of an association, design and implement it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find a way to practice working with the request parameters that makes sense in your application, e.g.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>implement a search&lt;/li>
&lt;li>implement a sort on a field&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create forms editing more than one object&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re more than 2 people in the group, pick a second view to work on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add rspec and basic test cases as discussed in class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up Continuous Integration with Travis (or another service)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploy your project to heroku.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag your project: &amp;ldquo;WEEK03&amp;rdquo; and push it to github.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Create end-to-end (feature or integration tests) for the feature or feature you&amp;rsquo;ve
created last week.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a test for exercise 2 of last week (search, sort, etc, whatever you&amp;rsquo;ve created)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create more feature tests if you want to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create a hand-rolled login-procedure following Chapter 8 of &lt;a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl&amp;rsquo;s Tutorial&lt;/a>. (note: this is to do it once yourself, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t create your own in a real project, but rather use a library)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do this either test-driven or add feature tests for the successful login.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tag your project: &amp;ldquo;WEEK04&amp;rdquo; and push it to github.&lt;/li>

you have a way to prioritize your backlog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide on one, two or a few stories you want to start with. You&amp;rsquo;re still learning the technology, but you should have a goal you&amp;rsquo;re aiming at.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Review and groom your Backlog. That is, if you&amp;rsquo;re created a click-dummy for one or more stories, you should defined new stories for actually implementing the functionality. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to estimate them.&lt;/li>
