Write down how Kara could solve the task for each one of them. For example, if the programming exercise was Exercise 4 from Worksheet 1, where Kara was to move in a Square and drop a leaf in each corner, you could write down something as this: 1. walk one edge (call move n times), 2.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 02: Shapes and TicketMachine</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-02/</guid><description>This week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended to acquaint you with the BlueJ environment.

You are also to begin to see the idea of modularization, that is, splitting up code into classes.
Pre-lab For the Tuesday group: we will be talking about boolean expressions in class on Tuesday. Therefore, I will set some time apart to let you work on the prelab in class as an exercise; you may however if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so for programming Kara do some reading about boolean expressions and prepare it before or at least give it a first try: https://en.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 05: A Better Notebook</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-05/</guid><description>Foto by waferboardThis week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended help you practice using loops.
Note: (19.11.2013) The Kara Special exercise is obligatory!
In Exercise 4, you are asked to write the remove with an Iterator. As we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet reached Iterators in class, you can either:
implement a removeFirstNote method with the for-each loop as seen in class or look up iterators and use the Iterator remove method The while/index-variant however, should delete all Notes meeting the criteria!</description></item><item><title>Exercise 06: Club Membership</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2013/info1/labs/exercise-06/</guid><description>Reform Club, Wikimedia CommonsThis week&amp;rsquo;s lab work is intended give you more practice using collections.

Each computer in WH C 579 is a so-called dual-boot computer that can boot to Windows or Ubuntu Linux, or Mac OS in WH C 537. As computer science students we expect you to be able to deal with Windows, Unix, and Mac OS operating systems. For this lab, you can work with Mac OS or Windows.</description></item></channel></rss>
