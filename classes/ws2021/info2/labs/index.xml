I am familiar with programming in IntelliJ:
I can create a new Java project in IntelliJ I remember most of the concepts from A1 Ex1 I can run my new Java project in IntelliJ I am ready to use Git:
I can clone an online repository I can create an empty repository on GitLab I can update my local repository&amp;rsquo;s remotes I can add changes to be committed I can commit changes I can push changes Pre-Lab (Do this BEFORE the lab) 1.</description></item><item><title>Info2: Exercise 01: Application Design</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-01/</guid><description>CRC Cards
Learning Goals After this lab you should be able to agree with each of the following statements.
I can use CRC Cards to design an application:
Using the underline methods, I can identify candidates for classes, methods and fields. By working through scenarios I can identify cases where a class needs to be split up. By working through scenarios I can identify cases where classes need to be merged.</description></item><item><title>Info2: Exercise 02: Implementing CRC Cards</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-02/</guid><description>Learning Goals After this lab you should be able to agree with each of the following statements. This looks like a lot, but it is all repetition from what you learned in Info1. Ideally you agree with each statement even before starting the lab.
I remember programming concepts concerning classes and objects:
I know the difference between classes and objects. I can instantiate an object. I remember programming concepts concerning fields and variable types:</description></item><item><title>Info2: Exercise 03: Histogram</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-03/</guid><description>Learning Goals After this lab you should be able to agree with each of the following statements.
I can handle File-based IO with Java:
I can read from a text file using a Reader, eg. BufferedReader. I can write to a text file using a Writer, eg. BufferedWriter. I close my streams after I finished reading or writing. I can use try-with-resources to make sure that in the end, a resource is always closed I can handle Exceptions:</description></item><item><title>Info2: Exercise 04: Chatterbox</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ws2021/info2/labs/lab-04/</guid><description>Learning Goals After this lab you should be able to agree with each of the following statements.
I can use the Socket API for TCP connections:
I can create a server that listens for and accepts connections I can create a client that makes a connection request to the server I can send text from a client to a server via streams I can send text from a server to a client via streams I can use multithreading for the server to handle multiple connection requests Pre-Lab Write down the code for the following questions and be able to explain what is happening.</description></item></channel></rss>
