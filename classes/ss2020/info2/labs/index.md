## Pre-Labs
As this semester the labs will take place online, it is IMPORTANT that you are familiar with the
exercise before the lab starts. Before the lab starts please:
* read through the whole exercise (see below)
* do the pre-lab 
* recap on what you did for the lecture
* post any questions on Moodle
* (form your new group and post the names of all group members on Moodle - see below)

## During the lab
During the lab you will be working on exercises in groups (see below) while communicating with each other and with me online. This is the plan for now, but it might change.

### Communication
You should join the BBB "Lab Hangout", you find it on the Moodle page at "Labs - General Topics". There'll be a short welcome from me and then one group after the other does a quick check in with me in so called "breakout rooms" to talk about the last assignment and questions. In the "Lab Hangout" you can always ask questions, or post them in the appropriate Moodle forum. 

### Exercises
There will be 13 labs. 
* [Exercise 01 - Application Design](lab-01)
* [Exercise 02 - Implementing CRC Cards](lab-02)
* [Exercise 03 - Histogram](lab-03)
* [Exercise 04 - Chatterbox](lab-04)
* [Exercise 05 - Execution times](lab-05)
* [Exercise 06 - Reverse Polish Notation](lab-06)
* [Exercise 07 - Recursive Triangles](lab-07)
* [Exercise 08 - Eight Queens](lab-08)
* [Exercise 09 - Probabilistic Algorithms](lab-09)
* [Exercise 10 - Getting from A to B](lab-10)
* [Exercise 11 - Finite State Automata and Sorting](lab-11)
* [Exercise 12 - Scrabble Cheater Basic Edition](lab-12)
* [Exercise 13 - Scrabble Cheater Deluxe](lab-13)

<!--
* [Exercise 14 - Ladders](lab-14) (please read before lab, and maybe download the data)
-->

## Groups
You will work in groups of two or three. You will switch groups after three or four labs. 
That means you should form new groups before the following labs:
* [Exercise 01 - Application Design](lab-01)
* [Exercise 04 - Chatterbox](lab-04)
* [Exercise 07 - Recursive Triangles](lab-07)
* [Exercise 10 - Getting from A to B](lab-10)

You can chose your team mates. Please post the names of all group members on Moodle. I will not form groups for you, this is your own responsability. If you have not signed up a team by posting on Moodle, you won't be able to hand anything in.

## Reports
### Deadline
Lab Reports are due at 10pm the night before your next lab.

### Grading
Lab reports won't be graded - they just get marked with "ok" or "not ok".  
A report is "not ok" if any of the following is True:
* the report is missing
* you are not transparent on who did what
* the report has too little significant content on the lab
* the report is not submitted correctly (see below)

You can use the late slot (see below) to hand in rejected Lab Reports again.

You will not be allowed to take the exam if any of the following is True
* more than one report is "not ok" by July 6
* you plagiarized

### Criteria
A report should contain:
1. a summary of what the lab was about
2. details on what you learned in this lab OR details on what the lab was about
3. if you were asked to write code: an explanation of how you tested your code
4. if questions were asked: the answers to the questions

*Transparency* You need to be transparent on who did what. Collaborating with people outside your group is ok, 
but be transparent about it! Using sources from the Internet/books is ok, but cite them appropriately!

*What if I our group didn't get the code to work?* It's ok not to have completely succeeded on the assignment, as long as
you have tried sufficiently.

*How long should the report be?* Elegance lays in the ability to get to the point in as few sentences as necessary.

*Language* You can write in English or German.

### How to submit correctly
Please submit *seperately*:
* A pdf with your report
* A zip folder with your code

Only one team member should upload the report. If team members upload different reports, I'll chose one at random to review.

### Late reports
11 of the 13 lab reports need to be handed in at or before the deadline.
That means you can hand in 2 reports as late as you want. 

*How to hand in late reports* 
There are 2 "late slots" for handing in reports after the deadline, but they have to be handed in before July 6. 

*What happens if I hand in late more than two reports?*
There's a penalty of 0.3 on the final grade for each if you hand in a third and forth report late (that is you get a grade of 1.3 instead of 1.0 and so on). Please use the "3rd late report" and "4th late report" slots for that. You can only hand in late up to 4 reports. A 5th late report will not be graded and is thus "not ok".

*But ...!*
If you fall ill for more than a week or are unable to continuously work on
the lab reports for some other reason, come talk to me or at least email me as
early as possible and we will find an individual solution.

## Quizzes
There might be short quizzes on Moodle where you can test your knowledge. 
They will be published when the lab starts and be closed after a certain amount of time.
Whether doing them will gain you any additional benefits is tbd.

## Review and Presentations of Lab Reports in the following Lab

There are a couple of important changes for the labs compared to Info1:

You are required to be able to present and explain your work **in the following lab** ("review"). How this is done will change from lab to lab, depending on the topic of the lab: one of you might be randomly chosen to present the work, I might talk to each or some of you individually, or it might even be a little quizz in moodle which should be easy to solve if you did the lab exercise.

If you happen to be drawn for presentation and refuse to present the report
(e.g. because you don't have the slightest idea what your group mates
have written or you just feel too shy that day) or are not present yourself,
you are required to present the report to me in person during my next office hours.

Apart from that, it's ok not to have completely succeeded on the assignment, as long as
you have tried sufficiently.

If I find out that you most probably didn't work on the lab yourself, or the
lab report has too little significant content regarding the assignment,
I might decide to reject the report.

Note that this is a (possibly) different thing than plagiarism.
Plagiarism - copying the work of others - is considered cheating and will
lead to failing the whole course.

If you become ill with the usual cold, plan to use up one of the late slots.
If you're having trouble keeping up for longer than a week, come talk to me
or send me an email and we'll figure something out.
