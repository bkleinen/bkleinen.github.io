# Welcome!

This course is an introduction to *algorithms and data structures*. It will be
taught in English and German with all written material in English. It will be
taught using the Java programming language, but it is not about the language.
Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned
primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in
Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and
algorithms which work on these data structures.

In particular we will be concentrating on how to solve (small) problems using a
programming language. At the end of the semester there will be an introduction to
another Programming Language - e.g. Python -  so that you get a feel for the
language and learn something about differences in programming languages.

Have a look at how this breaks down on this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## A Summer Term in a Closed University

Due to the regulations to avoid faster spread of the COVID-19 virus (see ) most of
the summer term will probably held remote.

We will do this as a kind of remote flipped classroom: We will provide materials
you need to prepare *before* the lecture and the lab. Lecture and Labs are
mainly to ask and discuss questions. We will do that with various means, starting
with a simple Moodle Chat.

**Thus, class and lab schedule will remain unchanged.** Although you are free
to work on the material any time you want, it will be best if you do that at
the same time as your group and the time we are available and will answer questions
immediately.

The schedule might be adapted to accommodate distance learning due to the
COVID-19 Situation.

The materials will be provided via Moodle. (there's a direct link in the menu bar).

## Meetings/Weekly Schedule

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab. The Lab will be held by
Linda Fernsel. Please refer to the LSF
for time and location information (link above in the External Links menu).

## Tutorial

There will be a tutorial held by Lotte Unckell. The Tutorial will be in
conjunction with the Labs this term.

## Grades & Exam

For passing Info2, you need to pass two parts:

- the Lab ("Programmierübungen mit Rücksprache")
- the Exam ("Klausur")

Note that as both, Lab Reports and the Exam are parts of the "Modulprüfung",
cheating on any of them will result in a 5,0 (nicht bestanden) for the whole
module and use up one of the three possible tries for this module.

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination. The exam will be an online exam
with three parts: a multiple-choice part, an essay part, and a programming part.

The Grade is determined by the grade of your exam.

There is a penalty on the grade for late or missing lab reports, see below.

### Labs
There will be 13 labs and you need to write a lab report for each. Lab reports won't be graded - they just get marked with "ok" or "not ok". 

**Deadline**: Reports are due 10pm the night before the next lab.

**Late reports**: 11 of the 13 lab reports need to be handed in at or before the deadline.
That means you can hand in 2 reports as late as you want. There are 2 "late slots" for handing in reports after the deadline, but they have to be handed in before July 6. You can use a late slot to hand in a rejected Lab Report again.

There's a penalty of 0.3 on the final grade for each if you hand in a third and forth report late (that is you get a grade of 1.3 instead of 1.0 and so on). Please use the "3rd late report" and "4th late report" slots for that. You can only hand in late up to 4 reports. A 5th late report will not be graded and is thus "not ok".

You will not be allowed to take the exam if any of the following is True
* more than one report is missing by July 6
* more than one report is "not ok"

This should allow for enough slack for the usual cold and grandpa's birthday.
If you fall ill for more than a week or are unable to continuously work on
the lab reports for some other reason, come talk to me or at least email me as
early as possible and we will find an individual solution.

More info about the Lab Reports and their assessment can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

### Lecture Notes

Upload your personal Notes in Moodle to gain a maximum of additional 8% bonus.

### Examinations for Students who already took Info2

If you already took an Info2 class (with Prof. Zhang or Prof. Weber-Wulff) and
completed the lab reports/exercise part there, you can skip the lab reports.

To do so, you have to
- send an email to the other Professor asking them to send your lab grades to me
- send me an email asking to accept them (you can do both in one email).

You have to do that at the beginning of the term, within the first or second
week. I will individually decide on the terms for grading (e.g., if the labs were
graded and counting 50% to the grade I might decide to apply that grading scheme)
and you will want to know this decision beforehand.

Whether you attend the lectures or not, is your own decision, but note that the
content of Info2 might differ. It's your responsibility to inform yourself about
the topics covered.
