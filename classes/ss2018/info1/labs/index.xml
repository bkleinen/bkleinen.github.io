Each computer is a so-called dual-boot computer that can boot to Windows or Ubuntu Linux. As computer science students we expect you to be able to deal with Windows, Unix, and Mac OS operating systems.
We have lots of rules for the labs, as they are used by many different people during the week. Usually we&amp;rsquo;re in one of three available labs, you find an overview of them including a link to the rules (&amp;ldquo;Laborordnung&amp;rdquo;) here.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 02: TicketMachine</title><link>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2018/info1/labs/exercise-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bkleinen.github.io/classes/ss2018/info1/labs/exercise-02/</guid><description>Printed Ticket.
