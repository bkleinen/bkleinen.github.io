After having a look into designing an object oriented application in lab 1 and 2, we will do a lot of small-scale programming in Java during this term. As in Info1, each lab has a pre-lab part, that you are expected to do before coming to the lab, an assignment that you work on during the lab. Usually, you're expected to turn in a report on what you did during the lab.

There are a couple of important changes for the labs compared with Info1:

1. You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in in pairs (2 people). Submissions are done in Moodle, **no late submissions** this term. Always hand in what you have on time. Each of the two members in a pair hand in the same report; if only your pair uploads it, you won't get points for it.

1. You are required to be able to present/explain your work **in the following lab** ("review"). How this is done will change from lab to lab, depending on the topic of the lab: one of you might be randomly chosen to present the work, I might talk to each or some of you individually, or it might even be a little quizz in moodle which should be easy to solve if you did the lab exercise.


[Last semesters, I found it necessary to clarify some more things about the reports.]({{site.baseurl}}general/guideline.html)
